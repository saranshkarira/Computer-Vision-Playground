# OpenCV Playground:
Implementing multiple Computer Vision and Image Processing techniques using OpenCV

## Requirements:
- Google Colab: For Notebooks(Not necessary, just don't run the setup part)
- Python3.6
- OpenCV3
- Numpy

## Implementations:
- [x] Overlays
- [x] Thresholding
- [x] Creating Masks
- [x] Color Filtering
- [x] Smoothing
- [x] Morphological Transformations
- [x] Gradients
- [x] Edge Detections
- [x] Template Matching
- [x] GrabCut
- [x] Foreground/Motion Extraction
- [x] Corner Detection
- [x] Feature Matching by BruteForce(HomoGraphy)
- [x] Background Reduction
- [x] Haar Cascades
- [ ] Manual Haar Cascades

### An Example of Canny Edge Detection:

## How to use the Repo:
- Some techniques are written in Colab and some are written as scripts, decision based on technique's computation needs as well as whether input was video/cam or an Image
- Colab Notebooks are stored in Notebooks/ ; Scripts are stored in Scripts/
- Processed and Raw Images are prefetched in Notebooks, while for scripts you'll need to supply your own feed, most likely video or a webcam feed.
